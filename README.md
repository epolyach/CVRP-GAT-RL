# GAT_RL

GAT_RL implements a Graph Attention Network (GAT)–based reinforcement‑learning solver for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). This code originates from a dissertation project and had an article presented at ICORES 2025 and unifies recent advances in learned routing heuristics into a single end‑to‑end framework. At its core, GAT_RL combines the attention‑based encoder–decoder architecture introduced by Kool et al. in “Attention, Learn to Solve Routing Problems!” with the residual edge‑graph attention enhancements proposed by Lei et al. (2021) [ARXIV](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02730). Training relies on the DiCE estimator (Differentiable Monte Carlo Estimator) to eliminate dual‑actor overhead while preserving solution quality.

## Features
- Attention‑based GAT encoder with residual edge features
- DiCE estimator for low‑variance, single‑actor policy gradients
- Flexible decoding strategies (greedy, sampling, beam search)
- Synthetic and CVRPLIB benchmark support
- Near‑optimal solutions with inference in seconds

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/DanielSacy/GAT_RL.git
cd GAT_RL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Quickstart

### Generate synthetic CVRP data
```bash
python generate_data.py --problem CVRP --num_nodes 50 --seed 42 --output data/cvrp50.pkl
```

### Train
```bash
python train.py \
  --dataset data/cvrp50.pkl \
  --model gat \
  --estimator dice \
  --epochs 100 \
  --batch_size 128
```

### Evaluate
```bash
python evaluate.py \
  --checkpoint checkpoints/cvrp50_dice.pt \
  --dataset data/cvrp50.pkl \
  --decode greedy
```
